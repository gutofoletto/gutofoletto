## About Me

I started studying about web development in 2007. Since then, I have obtained a master's degree in computer science, studied abroad, earned awards and scholarships throughout my academic journey.

**Today, I am software developer with focus on front-end web development**. But I can also work with back-end development when needed. Overall, I have a good knowledge base that allows me to understand new technologies quickly.

I learned the importance of sharing knowledge when I had the opportunity to be a lecturer to undergraduate students. Consequently, I started sharing with others by speaking and attending technology conferences and events.

Moreover, I like to study about user experience and human-computer interaction. That interest combined with my academic and technical background, **resulted in a skill set that covers the basic steps of a digital product's development, from information architecture to design and prototype**.
